Text-to-Token Conditional Training

Train or fine-tune your transformer model to generate discrete audio tokens (from a neural codec like EnCodec) conditioned on healing-themed text prompts.

Use a dataset with labels or descriptions related to healing, calm, meditation, or wellness to bias the model toward this style.

This step teaches the model to align text instructions with music token outputs that convey the healing mood.

Curate or Collect Healing Music Data

Gather or prepare a high-quality dataset of healing, ambient, meditative tracks with matching metadata or captions.

The better your data aligns with healing music characteristics, the more vivid and authentic the generated compositions will be.

Neural Codec (Decoder) Quality

Ensure your neural codec decoder (like the EnCodec decoder) is well trained or fine-tuned to produce smooth, high-fidelity audio from tokens.

This influences the audio realism and calmness needed for healing music.

Prompt Engineering

Develop and test rich text prompts that clearly express the desired healing qualities (e.g., “soft piano melody with gentle nature sounds and slow tempo”).

Use prompt variations to explore the stylistic breadth of healing music generated.

Post-Processing and Evaluation

Optionally apply audio post-processing or mastering to further enhance relaxation qualities.

Gather feedback from listeners or domain experts in healing music to iteratively refine model outputs and training data.

Deployment and Use

Integrate your model into an application or service where users can input healing-related text prompts and receive custom calming music tracks.

Provide control options for tempo, instrumentation, and mood for personalized healing experiences.
